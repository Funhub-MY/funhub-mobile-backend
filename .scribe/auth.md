# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {USER_TOKEN_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You will received a token to authenticate user requests after you logged in.
